                    Hello! I’m a web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. Born on January 1,
                    1998, I passed SLC in 2015 from Shree Siddha Devi Secondary School and pursued Management at Phidim Higher

                    I have a strong foundation in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Python</b>, and I specialize in building robust web
                    applications using the <b>Django framework</b>. Currently, I live in South Korea for work, and during my leisure
                    time, I focus on improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
